# Service Description — What You Can Do

This platform allows you to securely manage crypto assets using institutional-grade custody, without ever handling private keys.

Assets are protected by a regulated custodian, while the platform gives you visibility, control, and operational workflows.

## What You Can Do

### Use Warm Wallets for Operations

Warm wallets are designed for day-to-day activity with strong controls.

You can:

- View balances and transaction history
- Request outgoing transfers
- Send funds to approved addresses
- Track transactions that require approval
- See when a transaction is pending, approved, broadcast, or confirmed

Warm wallets are online but **never auto-sign**.

---

### Use Cold Wallets for Long-Term Storage

Cold wallets are used for treasury and reserves.

You can:

- Request transfers from cold storage
- Move funds from cold to warm wallets when liquidity is needed
- Track the full lifecycle of cold transfers
- See when a transfer is under offline custody review or completed

Cold transfers are intentionally slower and highly secure.

---

### Work with Teams and Roles

The platform is built for teams.

You can:

- Operate with multiple users and roles
- Request transfers without signing authority
- See who must approve a transaction
- Receive notifications as transfers progress

No single user can move funds alone.

---

### Full Visibility Without Key Responsibility

You always have transparency without custody risk.

You can:

- Monitor all wallets in one place
- Track every transfer from request to confirmation
- Access complete audit trails
- Export activity for reporting and compliance

You never:

- Handle private keys
- Sign transactions yourself
- Manage seed phrases
- Operate custody infrastructure

---

## What This Service Is For

- Fintech platforms managing user funds
- Companies operating crypto treasuries
- Teams requiring approvals and auditability
- Organizations that want institutional custody without building it themselves

---

## What This Service Intentionally Does Not Do

- No instant cold withdrawals
- No bypassing approvals
- No automated signing
- No private key exposure

These constraints are features designed to protect assets.

## The Promise

You control operations.  
Custody controls the keys.  
Security is never compromised.
